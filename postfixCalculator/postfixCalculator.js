/**
 * This function takes an argument that is a string
 * and returns the number value of the arguments with the operator afterward.
 *
 * Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every
 * operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation, which
 * puts the operator in the prefix position. It is also known as postfix
 * notation and is parenthesis-free as long as operator arities are fixed. The
 * description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan ≈Åukasiewicz,
 * who invented (prefix) Polish notation in the 1920s.
 *
 * Examples:
 *  postfixCalculator('1 2 3 + +');      //6
 *  postfixCalculator('13 2 4 * 5 + -'); //0
 *  postfixCalculator('7 3 + 20 /');    //0.5
 *
